      The kipferl, the origin of croissant, can be dated back to at least the
      13th century in Austria, and came in various shapes. The kipferl can be
      made plain or with nuts or other fillings (some consider the rugelach a
      form of kipferl).

      The birth of the croissant itself—that is, its adaptation from the plainer
      form of kipferl, before the invention of viennoiseries—can be dated to at
      least 1839 (some say 1838) when an Austrian artillery officer, August
      Zang, founded a Viennese bakery ("Boulangerie Viennoise")

      at 92, rue de Richelieu in Paris. This bakery, which served Viennese
      specialties including the kipferl and the Vienna loaf, quickly became
      popular and inspired French imitators (and the concept, if not the term,
      of viennoiserie, a 20th-century term for supposedly Vienna-style
      pastries). The French version of the kipferl was named for its crescent
      (croissant) shape and has become a universally identifiable shape across
      the world.
